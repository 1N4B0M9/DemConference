    <h1>Mission</h1>
    <h3>PA YDC aims to bring highschool students from across Pennsylvania together to build  a more united and effective organizing effort to elect a stronger future of leaders. The conference hopes to inspire a generation of changemakers and political activists to make their voices heard in the fight for a better future. In its inaugural year, PA YDC hopes to work with educators, leaders, and activists to bring together high school Democratic organizations in preparation for the 2023 election and future paramount elections to keep Pennsylvania welcoming, just, and sustainable for years to come. 
        PA has long been a political battleground and it is only with the work of younger generations that it will continue to push the nation in the most just direction during general elections and preserve excellence in state and local elections. YDC's intent is  to serve as a catalyst for that work by providing an opportunity for high school organizers to learn from, collaborate with, and motivate one another in the political arena.
